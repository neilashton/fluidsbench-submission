# fluidsbench-submission

Submission repository and approved-data feed for the [FluidsBench leaderboard](https://fluidsbench.org/).

> FluidsBench is currently a work in progress. The `dev` branch, split indexes, submissions, metrics, and profile curves are
> prototype dummy data and are not approved benchmark results.

## Responsibilities

FluidsBench follows the versioned [`open-reproducibility-3.0`](OPEN_REPRODUCIBILITY.md) track. Evaluation ground truth and case
IDs are public. The submission process deliberately separates four responsibilities:

1. Dataset owners pin the original public field-bearing files and publish an immutable canonical scoring support covering every
   required entity in those files. The support declares exact arrays, point/node/face/cell association, stable IDs, authoritative
   area, length, volume, or cell-area weights, case set, and coverage rules.
2. Participants run their own model, create predictions for that complete support, calculate per-case and aggregate metrics, and
   create the required profiles and spatial-discretization records. Inference may be chunked and a method may use a different
   internal representation, but its final mapped predictions must cover every official entity. Participants may optionally link
   public, versioned source code, model, environment, and artifact documentation.
3. Participants must run the FluidsBench contributor-stage validator before opening a pull request. Their package remains
   unapproved and is not included in the public feed.
4. A maintainer validates the submitted files, hash chain, exact case/support coverage, and metadata, then approves the package for
   publication.

FluidsBench does not execute the submitted code or model, regenerate predictions, or recompute base metrics from full prediction
fields as part of required approval. It plots and tabulates the submitter-created values and compares them with the fixed public
ground truth. Optional prediction sharing and optional maintainer checks are recorded separately and do not affect approval, rank,
citation eligibility, or promotion eligibility.

## Submission directory

Create one directory under the matching dataset:

```text
submissions/<dataset-id>/<submission-id>/
  submission.json
  evaluation-evidence.json
  discretization.json
  discretization/
    cases.jsonl
  metrics/
    cases.json
  prediction-artifact-checks.json # optional, maintainer-owned
  maintainer-validation.json   # added only by maintainers during approval
  profiles/
    index.json
    chunk-000.json
    chunk-001.json
```

Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens for the globally unique `submission-id`. Do not edit generated files under
`leaderboard/` directly.

New submissions use schema v3. The material under [`examples/v3-template/`](examples/v3-template/) demonstrates the fixed-support
and prediction-manifest formats; dataset-specific submission templates can be completed only after the dataset owner marks its
scoring support `official` and opens submissions. Existing directories under `submissions/` are historical v1 prototype fixtures,
and [`examples/v2-template/`](examples/v2-template/) is retained only to interpret historical v2 packages.

## 1. Calculate metrics

Read the selected dataset's page on the [FluidsBench website](https://fluidsbench.org/datasets/) and its machine-readable
specification under [`benchmark-specs/`](benchmark-specs/). The specification lists accepted splits, required metric IDs, units,
directions, profile panels, stations, and quantities. Where profile extraction depends on a dataset library, the optional
`profile_definition` binding also pins a machine-readable extraction file and its SHA-256 digest.

The equations, edge cases, fixed-support joins, and NumPy reference implementations are documented in
[`reference/README.md`](reference/README.md). Each dataset specification identifies the exact files and field associations. It uses
surface and flow-domain terminology for three-dimensional datasets. Lower-dimensional files are described by what they actually
represent: a two-dimensional flow domain, a two-dimensional surface manifold embedded in three dimensions, or a one-dimensional
boundary curve. Participants create keyed predictions using their own inference pipeline. The reference evaluator
joins those predictions to every benchmark-owned support ID and the fixed public ground truth, checks complete coverage, and
produces the metric evidence. Mapping or interpolation to the original public entities is part of the submitted evaluation
pipeline, so its error is included in the result.

For relative L2 field errors, the standard paired reporting policy is:

- on a three-dimensional surface, a two-dimensional surface manifold, or a one-dimensional boundary curve, report the area- or
  length-weighted result as the primary value and the unweighted result as a secondary value;
- in a three-dimensional volume, or the two-dimensional flow domain, report the unweighted result as the primary value and the
  volume- or area-weighted result as a secondary value; and
- calculate each test case separately, then macro-average the case results so every case has equal influence.

The weights are face area, curve length, cell volume, or cell area as appropriate. For point- or node-associated fields,
FluidsBench supplies the corresponding per-point or per-node weight from the exact pinned mesh. Submitters use those
benchmark-owned values; they do not independently reconstruct weights from a modified mesh. For vector fields, one entity weight
multiplies the squared vector magnitude, not each component as a separate spatial sample. The selected dataset's machine-readable
specification remains authoritative if its published source metric requires a documented exception.

```python
from reference.metrics import relative_l2

pressure_l2_percent = relative_l2(
    ground_truth_pressure,
    predicted_pressure,
    weights=surface_face_areas,
)
```

Large cases may be evaluated in chunks. For each case and metric, accumulate
`numerator = sum(w * ||prediction - ground_truth||^2)` and
`denominator = sum(w * ||ground_truth||^2)` across all chunks, together with the entity count and total weight. Take
`100 * sqrt(numerator / denominator)` only after the complete case has been accumulated. Never calculate an L2 value per chunk and
average those chunk values. Use `w = 1` for the unweighted variant and the benchmark-supplied area, length, volume, or cell-area
weight for the weighted variant.

Run the executable reference example with:

```bash
python3 -m reference.example_calculation
```

## 2. Prepare metrics, spatial metadata, and profiles

`submission.json` contains model, submitter, methodology, dataset, split, aggregate metrics, scoring-support, spatial-discretization,
case-metric, profile-index, evaluation, and optional open-artifact metadata. New submissions must match
[`schemas/v3/submission.schema.json`](schemas/v3/submission.schema.json). Historical approved schema-v2 packages remain readable and
publishable, but the contributor-stage validator rejects new v2 packages because they lack mandatory v3 evidence.

The required `evaluation` object records the FluidsBench reference version, exact command, and SHA-256 checksum of
`evaluation-evidence.json`; when code metadata is shared, it must also record the matching contributor code revision. The evidence
file repeats the command and submitted metric values and binds the dataset version, split digest, case set, scoring-support
manifest, spatial report, per-case metrics, profile-index checksum, and exact public profile-ground-truth release. New submissions
use
[`schemas/v3/evaluation-evidence.schema.json`](schemas/v3/evaluation-evidence.schema.json). This evidence is not a replacement for
scientific review and does not contain full surface or volume fields.

Every new package also declares `reproducibility.contract_version=open-reproducibility-3.0`, public result-package access, public
evaluation-only data use, and an open licence for submitted result data. Public code, model weights, environment files, and artifact
documentation are optional and do not affect approval, rank, citation, or promotion eligibility. When declared, code must be pinned
to a full commit, model and environment artifacts must be pinned by SHA-256, and code/model licences must use the allowed open SPDX
identifiers. See [`OPEN_REPRODUCIBILITY.md`](OPEN_REPRODUCIBILITY.md) for the complete eligibility and validation policy.

Every schema-v3 package includes the same structured methodology record covering architecture components, exact total and
submitter-trainable parameter counts, inputs and outputs, data handling, training stages, checkpoint selection, and measured
compute. Each dataset's `methodology-contract.json` names only that benchmark's existing required outputs; it does not change the
prediction or scoring process. A SHA-256 digest is required for every checkpoint file actually loaded by a parameterized method so
the result has an exact model identity; publishing those checkpoint bytes, source code, or a model archive remains optional. See
the repository-wide [`methodology guide`](METHODOLOGY.md) and, for the native-mesh workflow, the
[`DrivAerML participant guide`](benchmark-specs/drivaerml/PARTICIPANT_GUIDE.md).

The required `metrics/cases.json` records every test case, canonical support, support/scored counts, complete count and weight
coverage, unmapped/extrapolated counts, per-case metric values, and the additive sufficient statistics required by each relative-L2
metric. Those statistics include numerator, denominator, entity count, and total weight for the unweighted and
area-, length-, or volume-weighted variants.
Its aggregate `metric_values` must exactly match `submission.json`; macro-averaged spatial metrics are recalculated from its case
values by the validator. Global R2 and published dataset-reference RRMSE values are explicitly `aggregate_only`: the generic
evaluator calculates them from complete prediction arrays, while normal package validation checks their identities and rule
bindings without pretending to recompute them.

The required `discretization.json` distinguishes training input, training supervision, inference input, direct model output, and the
mapping to each canonical support. `discretization/cases.jsonl` records actual evaluation-case counts and mapping coverage. A method
may infer in chunks or use sparse points, grids, a participant mesh, or another representation internally. After the declared
mapping, however, it must provide exactly one prediction for every required entity in the original public field-bearing files.
When a native-resolution comparison is reported, each case supplies its model/native counts and fraction; the validator reconciles
those records with the fixed or minimum/median/maximum summary and verifies `fraction = model_count / native_count`.

Contributors leave `approval` absent and must not add `maintainer-validation.json` or
`prediction-artifact-checks.json`. After submitted-data validation, maintainers add
the separately hashed validation record and `approval.status=approved`. Prototype packages use `approval.status=prototype`; the feed
builder publishes only prototype and maintainer-approved rows. The sole exception class is an exact maintainer-registered,
hash-bound HiLiftAeroML `pre_release_reference`; each remains unapproved and explicitly ineligible for citation or promotion.

Sharing full or example prediction fields is optional. When used, `prediction_artifacts` points to a revision-pinned public Hugging
Face dataset manifest. A maintainer may add one `prediction-artifact-checks.json` index recording accessibility, format, or explicit
metric-recomputation checks. Normal CI validates metadata and local hashes only and never downloads multi-gigabyte artifacts.

Profile data is kept out of the scalar leaderboard feed. Each chunk contains a manageable group of test geometries using compact
parallel arrays:

```json
{
  "case_id": "ahmedml_geometry_test_0001",
  "series": [
    {
      "panel_id": "pressure_profiles",
      "station_id": "upper_body_centerline",
      "quantity_id": "cp",
      "coordinate": [0.0, 0.5, 1.0],
      "prediction": [0.72, -0.31, 0.04]
    }
  ]
}
```

Use roughly 20-30 geometries per chunk. Coordinates must be finite, unique, and strictly increasing. Every required case,
panel, station, quantity, and any exact coordinate/sample-count rule is declared by the dataset specification and its bound
profile definition. Prototype fixtures may use an explicitly declared abridged profile only while they remain labelled
`approval.status=prototype`. The profile schemas are:

- [`schemas/v1/profile-index.schema.json`](schemas/v1/profile-index.schema.json)
- [`schemas/v1/profile-chunk.schema.json`](schemas/v1/profile-chunk.schema.json)

New maintainer validation records must match
[`schemas/v3/maintainer-validation.schema.json`](schemas/v3/maintainer-validation.schema.json).

For schema v3, `profile_data.profile_ground_truth_release_id` and
`profile_data.profile_ground_truth_manifest_sha256` must exactly match `data_release.profile_ground_truth` in the leaderboard
manifest. The same values are repeated in the submitter-authored evaluation evidence and the maintainer validation record.

The profile index records the SHA-256 checksum and case IDs for each chunk. Normal JSON is used so pull requests remain readable;
hosting can compress it during delivery.

## Result versions

Published result packages are immutable. Every schema-v3 submission declares a stable result series and an integer version:

```json
"submission_id": "team-model-drivaerml-full-v2",
"result_revision": {
  "series_id": "team-model-drivaerml-full",
  "version": 2,
  "supersedes": "team-model-drivaerml-full-v1",
  "change_summary": "Retrained the model and corrected the mesh-to-support mapping."
}
```

The first package is `<series-id>-v1`, uses `version: 1`, and sets `supersedes` to `null`. An update copies the previous package into
a completely new `<series-id>-vN` directory, replaces every changed prediction, metric, profile, evidence record, and checksum,
increments the version by exactly one, points to the immediately preceding published submission, and explains the material change.
Never edit, rename, or delete an earlier published directory.

For a result published before this versioning contract whose ID does not end in `-v1`, keep that package unchanged. Its first update
uses `<legacy-submission-id>-v2`, retains `<legacy-submission-id>` as the series ID, and sets `supersedes` to the exact legacy ID. For
example, `drivaerml-ab-upt-v2` supersedes `drivaerml-ab-upt`. The validator treats that immutable legacy package as v1.

A revision remains in the same series only when the exact dataset version, split hash, case set, submitter, and institution are
unchanged. A genuinely different benchmark contract, model family, or submitting team starts a new series at v1. The validator
rejects skipped versions, forks, missing or unpublished predecessors, non-chronological dates, and IDs that do not match
`<series-id>-vN`.

The current leaderboard ranks only the latest published version in each series, so repeated updates cannot occupy multiple ranking
positions. Earlier versions, their submitted scores, dates, metadata, and change summaries remain in the hash-bound revision-history
feed and are available from the result details. An immutable release snapshot continues to preserve the exact version and rank that
it originally published. Historical schema-v1/v2 packages are exposed as v1-compatible legacy records; all new schema-v3 packages
must declare `result_revision` explicitly.

## 3. Validate and submit

Create a Python environment and install the two validation/reference dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Validate one directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_submission.py --contributor-stage submissions/ahmedml/my-model-v1
```

Dataset owners may exercise a closed schema-v3 candidate before activation
only when the dataset specification pins an exact
`scoring_support.candidate_manifest` (status, release ID, repository file,
public URL, and SHA-256):

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_submission.py --candidate-dry-run submissions/<dataset-id>/<package-id>
```

This mode requires `scoring_support.status=candidate`,
`submissions_open=false`, and a candidate support manifest. It rejects approval
and maintainer-owned metadata and reports only non-approving candidate
validity. Normal and `--contributor-stage` validation continue to require an
official, open, owner-approved scoring-support release.

Validate every source submission and verify that generated feeds are synchronized:

```bash
python3 scripts/manage_leaderboard.py check
```

The validator checks JSON schemas, exact public split and complete original-support coverage, unweighted and area-, length-, or
volume-weighted relative-L2 sufficient statistics, case-metric aggregation, spatial counts and domains, declared mappings,
evaluation-evidence
identities and checksums, profile coverage, coordinate ordering, array lengths, finite values, split/chunk hashes, any declared
open-artifact metadata, and approval lifecycle rules. It does not execute the model, download optional remote predictions, or
recompute submitted base metrics.

After validation:

1. Commit exactly one new submission directory. Do not modify schemas, specifications, validators, workflows, generated feeds, or
   existing submissions in the same pull request. Use a new globally unique `<series-id>-vN` submission ID and the revision rules
   above.
2. Open a pull request against `main` once FluidsBench announces that the dataset is accepting real submissions.
3. Complete the pull request checklist and resolve all automated validation failures.
4. Maintainers review scientific provenance, public-evaluation-use eligibility, metadata, submitted values, result-data licence,
   and any declared artifact metadata, then merge the contributor package while it is still unapproved and absent from public
   feeds.
5. A maintainer can run the **Maintainer approve and regenerate** workflow with the exact submission path, validator/approver
   identities, validation timestamp, and approval date. It creates the validation record, binds the resulting draft PR URL,
   rebuilds and verifies the compact feeds, and opens the protected-branch PR. The final merge remains manual.
6. Optional prediction checks use the separate **Check optional prediction artifact metadata** workflow. Their presence or outcome
   is descriptive and never changes approval or claim eligibility.

External pull requests are restricted to one entirely new submission directory. Maintainers may deliberately apply the restricted
`trusted-maintenance` label to allow a reviewed external repository-maintenance contribution; validation/approval changes must still
come from a maintainer-owned branch.

## Generated leaderboard feeds

Source submissions are converted into release-specific compact scalar feeds. Prototype releases contain only explicitly marked
prototype rows; official releases contain only validated and approved submitted-data rows:

```text
leaderboard/
  manifest.json
  datasets/<dataset-id>.json
  all.json
  revisions.json
  claims/
    index.json
    <dataset-id>/<split-id>/<submission-id>.json
leaderboard.json
```

The website loads the selected scalar dataset lazily. `all.json`, `leaderboard.json`, and the dataset files contain only the latest
version of each result series and therefore define the current rankings. `revisions.json` is a separately hash-pinned, unranked
history containing every published version. Profile arrays are not copied into these feeds; each row contains a relative profile
index path, and the browser fetches only the selected geometry's chunk.

`leaderboard/manifest.json` also publishes the data-release identifier, generation time, source reference, contract version,
licence scope, archive URL, immutable asset base, SHA-256 digest of the complete scalar feed, and the expected release ID and
manifest digest for the public profile ground truth. Every feed row carries the SHA-256 digest of its profile index. Prototype
releases use `archive_url: null`; an official release must provide an immutable HTTPS archive URL plus asset-base and interactive
release-view URLs containing the release ID. The separate full `source_commit` records repository provenance without creating a
self-referential commit hash.

HiLiftAeroML's ten registered Transolver previews use the compact-v2
prediction contract. Their public Cp and velocity comparison truth lives in
the website repository as a deduplicated 1,355-case release covering all eight
official case sets. It is bound as plot-only metadata; the private lossless
evaluator truth remains the scoring authority and is not copied into this
repository.

Official `asset_base_url` and `release_view_url` values are clean HTTPS directory bases: their final path segment is exactly the
safe lowercase release ID, they end in `/`, and they contain no query or fragment. Official builds preserve the manifest's explicit
timezone-qualified generation timestamp. If generated claims already exist for that official release ID, the builder refuses any
changed feed digest, ranking contract, claim set, or published claim metadata; a new release requires a new ID and matching URL
bases. This makes result permalinks and relative release-asset URLs identical across Python, JavaScript, archives, and CDNs.

Ranks are release records, not live-page claims. They are calculated within exactly one release, dataset, and split using the
dataset's declared ranking metric and its published decimal precision. Values are rounded in decimal with `decimal_half_up`, then
competition-ranked (`1, 2, 2, 4`); the rounded value is also the displayed value, so two visibly equal results cannot receive
different ranks. The feed publishes the raw value, rounded/display value, rank, ranked-result count, and tie count in each row's
`ranking` object.

Every release also generates one machine-readable result-claim record per feed row. The claims index hashes every record, and the
release manifest hashes the index. Each record identifies the release, result, ranking scope and policy, feed digest, source
submission, evaluation evidence, and profile-index bindings. Schema-v3 claims additionally bind the scoring-support identity and
URL, spatial report, spatial case records, and per-case metric evidence; a recorded optional prediction check is also hashed.
Official records additionally bind maintainer validation and provide an immutable result permalink based on
`data_release.release_view_url`; `archive_url` remains the separate DOI or data-archive landing page. Each claim's exact byte URL is
its repository-relative `leaderboard/claims/...` path under the immutable
`data_release.asset_base_url`. The build chain is deliberately one-way: ranked feed, feed digest, claim records, claims-index
digest, then manifest pin.

`bindings.result` identifies the exact-byte-hashed complete feed and the row's zero-based array index. A verifier hashes the feed
bytes, loads that indexed row, and compares its identity, ranking, eligibility, and artifact bindings with the claim. This avoids
language-dependent JSON number canonicalization while retaining a byte-for-byte release link.

The generated-artifact checker also verifies that `record_count` and `eligible_record_count` equal the claim-index contents; these
cross-field equalities are semantic checks beyond what the portable JSON Schema expresses.

Prototype claim records remain useful for testing the interface, but explicitly set academic-citation and promotion eligibility to
false and have no immutable permalink. Official records state that validation covered submitted data only. Prediction sharing and
optional check status are published as separate descriptive fields and do not change eligibility. The schemas are
[`schemas/releases/result-claim.schema.json`](schemas/releases/result-claim.schema.json) and
[`schemas/releases/claim-index.schema.json`](schemas/releases/claim-index.schema.json).

Maintainers rebuild and verify feeds with:

```bash
python3 scripts/manage_leaderboard.py build
python3 scripts/manage_leaderboard.py check
```

## Prototype split indexes

Current split indexes are marked `prototype_generated`. They preserve the dummy leaderboard's declared test counts but are not
official dataset case lists. Dataset owners must replace them with approved immutable case IDs and change the status to `official`
before real submissions are accepted. A submission records the exact split-index SHA-256 so later split changes are detectable.

## License

Repository code and published leaderboard metadata are covered by the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). Each real submission declares
an open `reproducibility.result_data_license_spdx` for its contributed profile values and result material; submitters must have the
right to provide them under that licence. Upstream datasets and model artifacts retain their own declared licences. Code and model
artifacts are optional. If supplied, they must be publicly accessible and use one of the explicitly allowed open SPDX identifiers
in the v3 submission schema. See the category-specific lists in
[`OPEN_REPRODUCIBILITY.md`](OPEN_REPRODUCIBILITY.md); proprietary and unrecognised declared licence values fail validation.
