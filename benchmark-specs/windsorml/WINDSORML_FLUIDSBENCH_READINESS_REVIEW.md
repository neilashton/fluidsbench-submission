# WindsorML FluidsBench readiness review

Date: 2026-09-17

## Executive conclusion

The public WindsorML release contains enough native CFD data to support a real
FluidsBench contract, and this branch delivers one: a pinned source identity, the
eight official split bindings, a bounded-memory evaluator, a split scorer, and a
test suite. The prototype material it replaces was dummy data — a single
fabricated case ID (`windsorml_default_test_0001`), four fabricated velocity
stations, and ten dummy submissions — none of which should ever have been scored.

Two things are **not** ready and are held back deliberately: the profile panels
(the velocity stations were invented and need a real physical choice), and the
cell-volume-weighted volume metrics (the sidecars are unaffordable at this mesh
size). Submissions stay closed pending owner review.

WindsorML is in several respects *easier* than AhmedML: its field associations
are unambiguous, and its surface quadrature weights are published rather than
evaluator-generated. It is harder in exactly one respect — force integration
does not reproduce the published coefficients to machine precision — and that
drove the single most consequential design decision here.

## Pinned inputs

- Public dataset: `neashton/windsorml`
- Immutable revision: `8a6ca32ae22c94f54df2186d1b0ccf9662a294c2`
- Local mirror: `/lustre/.../users/nashton/windsorml/data`

The mirror was downloaded and verified on 2026-09-16: **3,178 files, 7.769 TB**,
every file byte-exact against the Hub-reported size, zero missing. Per-run
`images/` were excluded by design (192,851 files, ~45 GB). Six stray upload-temp
files live in the repo (`run_287/volume_287.vtu.CFC7E38A` and similar, 35.7 GB
total); every affected run also carries its correct payload, so they are excluded
and should be deleted from the Hub separately.

As an independent check, the 350 freshly pulled `boundary_*.vtu` were compared
against a previously downloaded copy at
`datasets/native_surface_boundaries/windsorml/`: 350/350 identical in size, and
byte-identical on spot samples.

## Native inventory

Read with `vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader.UpdateInformation()` (metadata only — a
full read of a 21 GB volume file needs well over 100 GB of RAM):

| | association | arrays |
|---|---|---|
| `boundary_N.vtu` | **PointData** | `cpavg`, `cfxavg`, `cfyavg`, `cfzavg`, `cpvar`, `yplusavg`, `Normals` (CellData holds only `faceid`) |
| `volume_N.vtu` | **CellData** (PointData empty) | `velocityxavg/yavg/zavg`, `pressureavg`, and six Reynolds stresses |

Scale across the 350 published runs: **2,021,398–2,650,517 surface points** and
**267,431,654–330,440,927 volume cells**.

Unlike AhmedML, arrays are not duplicated across associations, so the "evaluator
must explicitly select CellData" ambiguity does not arise. `faceid` takes a
single value, so the boundary is the body only and no patch selection is needed.

`boundary_dual_area_N.npy` is float32, one positive barycentric dual area per
native point, in point order. It is the canonical surface weight and must not be
recomputed — the dataset README warns that VTK polygon-area recomputation drifts
for non-planar quads. This removes AhmedML's need for a generated surface-area
sidecar entirely.

## The axis convention

**The vertical axis is +y, not +z.** AhmedML and DrivAerML both use +z for lift,
so this is the single easiest thing to get wrong.

Measured bounds for run_0: x ∈ [−0.561, 0.483], y ∈ [0, 0.343] (ground plane
upward), z ∈ [−0.1945, +0.1945] (laterally symmetric). Integrating the
coefficient fields against the published dual areas with `A_ref = 0.112 m²`:

| axis | integrated | published | difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| x → `cd` | 0.28108820 | 0.28181696 | 0.26% |
| **y → `cl`** | **0.48836350** | **0.48822198** | **0.03%** |
| z → `cs` | −0.01127239 | 0.00082344 | small absolute |

Mapping lift to +z instead collapses `cl` from ~0.49 to ~−0.01 — a plausible
looking number that is silently wrong. `reference/windsorml/contract.py` freezes
the mapping and `tests/test_windsorml_evaluator.py` regression-guards it.

## Force convention, and why the published CSV is not the scoring truth

`force_mom_*.csv` uses a constant reference area; recovered exactly as
`frontal_area × cd_varref / cd_fixed` = **0.112 m²**. `force_mom_varref_*.csv`
uses each case's own frontal area. The constant-area table is authoritative here,
matching how the `high_drag`/`low_drag` split families were built.

Predicted coefficients can only come from integrating predicted fields. If truth
came from the CSV instead, the gap between the dual-area point quadrature and the
solver's exact cell integration would become an error floor that no prediction
could reach, and `cd_r2` could never be 1. Across all published runs that gap
reaches **2.94% on drag** — a severe floor.

So **truth and prediction are integrated identically**, and the published CSV is
retained as an audit anchor: the truth integration must reproduce it within a
frozen tolerance, which refuses a case whose mesh, weights, or axis mapping has
drifted. AhmedML can fail closed at 2e-6 because its cell-area integration
reproduces its solver exactly; WindsorML cannot, and pretending otherwise would
have been the wrong contract.

### Replay tolerance

Observed absolute deltas between the published CSV and the truth integration:

| | median | p95 | max |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cd` | 0.000037 | 0.004562 | 0.008926 |
| `cl` | 0.000006 | 0.000780 | 0.003369 |

The audit is `|replay − published| ≤ 0.005 + 0.02 × |published|`. With the
relative term fixed at 0.02, the tightest absolute term that still admits every
published run is 0.002849, so 0.005 keeps about 1.75x headroom.

A purely relative bound would be wrong: lift and side force can be legitimately
near zero. `run_306` publishes `cl = +0.000106`, where a negligible 0.000328
offset is a **310% relative** difference. The absolute term carries small
coefficients; the relative term keeps large ones honest.

## Splits and the scored case set

The dataset ships its own authoritative split manifest at `splits/manifest.json`:
eight families over 355 design variants. But `run_350`–`run_354` have no per-run
payload in the public release, and two of them land in test sets.

FluidsBench therefore scores the **intersection of the official manifest with the
350 published runs**. The official manifest is neither modified nor regenerated;
each split file records the official counts and the excluded IDs.

| family | official test | scored | excluded |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| full / medium / scarce / super_scarce | 36 | 35 | `run_354` |
| geometry | 71 | 71 | — |
| high_drag | 71 | 70 | `run_352` |
| low_drag | 71 | 70 | `run_354` |
| image_wake | 71 | 71 | — |

**235 → 233 unique scored test cases.** WindsorML numbers are therefore not
comparable to any future run against the full official manifest; the spec says so.

The splits README already documents the 355/350 asset gap and imputes geometry and
wake scores for the five, so the *assignment* is deliberate. What it does not
address — and what this reduction fixes — is that a scoring contract needs ground
truth for every test case it scores.

## What was built

- `reference/windsorml/contract.py` — hash-pinned source identity, frozen axis and
  force convention, force-replay audit. Accepts `run_0` (WindsorML is 0-indexed;
  AhmedML's `run_([1-9][0-9]*)` pattern rejects it).
- `reference/windsorml/evaluator.py` — bounded-memory per-case evaluator over
  inline-binary VTU, chunk- and order-invariant.
- `reference/windsorml/dataset_scorer.py` — split reduction; macro-averaged field
  metrics, pooled coefficient R². Score transforms come from `reference/scores.py`
  so WindsorML cannot disagree with the other datasets about `bounded_error`.
- `reference/windsorml/prediction_chunks.py` — WindsorML-owned transport shim.
- `benchmark-specs/windsorml/` — pinned source identity, eight real split files,
  rewritten `submission-spec.json`.
- `tests/test_windsorml_{contract,evaluator,dataset_scorer}.py` — 38 tests.

### Shared-module change

`reference/drivaerml/prediction_chunks.py` needed three backwards-compatible
extensions, because WindsorML is the first dataset with a **PointData** support
and the first that is 0-indexed:

1. the case-ID pattern now admits `run_0`;
2. `association` is looked up per support rather than hard-coded to `CellData`;
3. the WindsorML supports and format are registered.

Verified neutral: the full suite is **9 failed / 679 passed** both with and
without the change, an identical failure set. Those nine failures are
pre-existing and environmental — they require Python 3.12.13 and the container
provides 3.12.3.

Separately, `tests/test_ahmedml_development_fixture.py` writes into the **live
tracked fixture** that `tests/test_validator.py::test_complete_example_is_valid`
then validates, so that test passes or fails depending on execution order. It is
unrelated to WindsorML but worth fixing.

## Profile diagnostics: two placement families

Following the DrivAerML relative-diagnostics contract, every diagnostic kind is
published twice:

| | placement | scoring role | weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| `windsorml_velocity_constant_v1` | fixed absolute coordinates | ranked | 0.15 |
| `windsorml_velocity_relative_v1` | vertical rescaled by body height | report only | 0.0 |
| `windsorml_cp_constant_v1` | fixed absolute coordinates | ranked | 0.10 |
| `windsorml_cp_relative_v1` | vertical rescaled by body height | report only | 0.0 |

WindsorML needs a far smaller relative frame than DrivAerML. Streamwise and
lateral extents are identical in all 350 published runs, so a constant x or z
station is already the same physical location everywhere; **only body height
varies, from 0.316 m to 0.473 m**, so only the vertical coordinate is rescaled
as `eta = y / h_case`.

Both are needed. A constant cut at y = 0.194 m is 61% of the shortest body's
height but 41% of the tallest, so it samples a different part of the roof shear
layer per case and the metric partly measures geometry. A relative cut at fixed
`eta` samples the same position in the shear layer everywhere, but is no longer
a fixed physical probe. Publishing both, with only one weighted, follows the
DrivAerML rule that at most one placement mode per diagnostic kind may carry
nonzero weight.

Relative `eta` values are anchored so each relative station reduces exactly to
its constant counterpart on run_0 (`eta_cut = 0.56491`, `h = 0.34342 m`). That
was verified on real data: the two families produce identical series for all
five velocity stations and the side cut. Only `cp_base_vertical` differs, which
is the intended fix -- the constant line spans y in [0, 0.5] and overshoots the
0.343 m body, while the relative one spans exactly the base.

## Deliberately deferred

- **Nothing. Profile support is complete.** All 233 scored cases are generated,
  validated and hash-pinned by
  `profile-support/windsorml-profile-support-v3-manifest.json`. Every case
  reports exactly 8 containment fallbacks, which is the expected pattern: the
  eight vertical stations each begin at y = 0 on the ground plane, outside the
  fluid mesh, while the two lateral stations report none.
- **Cell-volume-weighted volume metrics are removed, not stubbed.** At ~291M
  cells × 350 cases the sidecars cost roughly 400 GB and 1,000 CPU-hours. The
  primary volume metric was already equal-cell weighted.

## Release state

### Runtime profile enforcement

The case evaluator verifies the profile definition, support manifest, and case
support bytes against immutable SHA-256 pins before reading prediction fields.
An in-memory support document must exactly match the canonical pinned document.
Case evidence records the definition, source, manifest and case-support hashes.

The split scorer independently verifies those bindings and requires all three
Cp and five velocity stations in both placement families, with exactly 128
finite samples per station. It rejects missing, duplicate or unknown stations,
changed coordinates, and truth that disagrees with the pinned support under the
existing native-stream tolerance. Station serialization order does not change
the score. Regenerate earlier case evidence with the evaluator to supply these
bindings. The station definitions, sample locations and score formulas are
unchanged.

Every technical decision is settled and recorded in the spec: the scored case
set, the component weights, the stations and resolution, and the sampling
semantics. `scoring_support.status` remains `owner_review_required` and
`submissions_open` remains false, because the repository validator holds those
to a closed vocabulary and requires a non-empty decision list; the single
remaining entry is `approve_release_and_open_submissions`, which is a release
decision rather than a technical one.

Measured body height across all 233 scored cases is **0.29957 m to 0.48888 m**,
wider than the 0.31574-0.47340 m taken from an eight-run sample during design.
The constant horizontal cut at y = 0.194 m still lies inside every body, and the
spread it motivates is slightly larger than first documented: 65% of the
shortest body's height against 40% of the tallest.

## Owner decisions required

1. Approve the 235 → 233 scored-case reduction.
2. Review the relative placement families and decide whether either should ever
   take the ranked weight in place of the constant family.
3. ~~Approve component weights.~~ Approved 2026-09-17, unchanged at field 0.50 /
   force 0.25 / diagnostic 0.25. That is identical to AhmedML and HiLiftAeroML
   component for component, and to DrivAerML apart from its force group, which
   splits three ways (cd 0.15, cl 0.05, c_pitch 0.05) because it scores pitching
   moment. WindsorML publishes `cmy`, so a `c_pitch_r2` term is supported by the
   data, but it would need surface moment integration and a moment reference
   point the dataset does not publish. Not adopted.
4. Decide whether `geo_parameters_all.csv` or the per-run CSVs are authoritative —
   the aggregate omits `ratio_length_front_rear`, which the splits README
   documents and works around, but participants need to be told which to use.
5. Delete the six stray `.vtu.XXXXXXXX` upload temporaries from the Hub.
