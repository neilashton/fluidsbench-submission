# DrivAerML candidate evidence index

This directory contains implementation evidence and diagnostic pilot records
for the closed DrivAerML candidate contract. Presence here does not make an
artifact official scoring support, owner-approved evidence, or an accepted
submission. Repository-relative proposal, profile, and evidence paths in the
machine contract resolve from `benchmark-specs/drivaerml/`; upstream dataset
paths instead resolve within the pinned `neashton/drivaerml` release.
The same file identities and non-activation status are available to tooling in
[`manifest.json`](manifest.json).

The benchmark owner decided on 2026-08-21 that the 209 discrete Cp probes are
excluded from the current participant submission and score. Every discrete-
probe Cp artifact indexed here is retained only as inactive research evidence.
It is not a participant requirement, evaluator dependency, composite component,
scoring support, or activation gate; its presence does not authorize probe
scoring. Four continuous Cp cuts remain in scope, but they require separate
extraction evidence and support that is not supplied by these probe artifacts.

| Artifact | SHA-256 | Scope and eligibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`force-replay-all484.json`](force-replay-all484.json) | `631cd02c3a4215b254489652c1d93dfd781ecdb9478ff1ab11f24294743e8a17` | Passing candidate evaluator replay for all 484 cases, including fixed-area audit and chunk invariance. Dataset-owner scientific approval remains pending; this does not activate scoring. |
| [`native-volume-run1-run44-equal-cell-primary-pilot.json`](native-volume-run1-run44-equal-cell-primary-pilot.json) | `d009b6ac708fa320d21492b4cc44fc846b61e99b445836b5dedc704a934592d7` | Two-case implementation evidence for multipart reconstruction, native fields, raw order, complete coverage, and equal-cell metric invariance. It covers only `run_1` and `run_44` and is not scoring support. |
| [`native-volume-equal-cell-primary-all484.json`](native-volume-equal-cell-primary-all484.json) | `bda42a125ffb4d6484756e77ac7e495974f39d4bce3e663154322e9e560827c7` | Passing all-484 audit of 978 pinned VTU segments, native `CellData`, tuple/component counts, finite values, declared units, raw-cell order and complete duplicate-free coverage. Two chunk partitions agree within `2.22e-16` for additive statistics and `5.69e-14` for metrics. This directly exercises the equal-native-cell volume contract; it is not a physics-null baseline, model result, or scoring support. |
| [`native-volume-equal-cell-primary-all484-provenance.json`](native-volume-equal-cell-primary-all484-provenance.json) | `b5ffe2234bb1597cf041ff5d97458f3d0d6e81db7a30591a7e26f51ebc032fde` | Path-free provenance for the all-484 audit: exact committed generator revision and source hashes, Python/NumPy runtime, launcher hash, scheduler scope, aggregate hash, and a canonical digest over all 484 external case-receipt identities. It does not turn the audit into scoring support or bundle the 10.7 MB receipt set. |
| [`velocity-mapping-run1-run44-candidate-v7-pilot.json`](velocity-mapping-run1-run44-candidate-v7-pilot.json) | `91a7bb4cb7b7c6167c3577f62745021409c93cebc6b2685a57cdfe1debc06d76` | Explicit non-public candidate-v7 containing-cell geometry pilot for `run_1` and `run_44`. The compact aggregate accounts for all 134,768 requested rows at 1, 2, 5, and 10 mm, including 4,489 invalid rows, and hash-binds the complete duplicate-free external row-level mapping files. It is not an all-case tolerance replay, prediction convergence result, model-ordering result, validity mask, or scoring support. |
| [`velocity-run1-run44-candidate-v7-pilot-provenance.json`](velocity-run1-run44-candidate-v7-pilot-provenance.json) | `be785d01618584691a60bba9faa8125376ac788dae1cfeeaf763e97fc7ff767e` | Path-free binding for the two-case velocity pilot: exact committed mapping revision and source hashes, Python/NumPy/VTK runtime, launcher and scheduler identities, external receipt and mapping identities, and a byte-identical separate-process `run_1` repeat. It makes no activation, approval, model, convergence, or participant dry-run claim. |
| [`real-reference-driver-run1-run44-candidate-v7-pilot.json`](real-reference-driver-run1-run44-candidate-v7-pilot.json) | `da80aebb11eb18d3bb66b7a968a94e9a779a6e60f5413ef73d2fbd6485d76572` | Passing candidate-only reference-driver receipt for pinned real `run_1` and `run_44` inputs. It verifies two- and three-part native-volume transport, complete deterministic all-zero surface and volume prediction chunks, equal-native-cell volume weighting, and consistent prediction identities across the core and diagnostic evaluators. The chunks are a transport and reduction fixture, not a model, physics-null baseline, participant dry run, or scoring result. |
| [`real-reference-driver-run1-run44-candidate-v7-pilot-provenance.json`](real-reference-driver-run1-run44-candidate-v7-pilot-provenance.json) | `24fd18d70098e5943959c8f37e2cd0ade211322e0785734d0dd035200db8fff2` | Path-free binding for the reference-driver pilot: exact committed driver revision and source hashes, runtime, launcher and completed scheduler job, execution-config hash, all-zero fixture receipts and manifests, fixed surface-area arrays, historical candidate discrete-probe Cp supports, 10 mm velocity mappings, and external child-evidence identities. The probe inputs record what the historical pilot consumed and are neither current Cp-cut support nor current requirements. The artifact does not make the candidate evaluator frozen or public scoring support. |
| [`volume-weight-vtk-run_1-failure-diagnostic.json`](volume-weight-vtk-run_1-failure-diagnostic.json) | `aa2a209cafbd598930bfbe2dd1a73e8c06108188aff69c30841bfc46bfe7927e` | Superseded historical record for a rejected geometric cell-volume experiment. Geometric volume weights are not part of the equal-native-cell contract; this file has no scoring or activation role. |
| [`volume-weight-vtk96-run_1-wedge-probe.json`](volume-weight-vtk96-run_1-wedge-probe.json) | `2970c507038bc1c3978542cc8e07c6682230db496f646a4887467645304a58a6` | Superseded historical isolated-cell experiment under VTK 9.6.0. Geometric volume weights are not part of the equal-native-cell contract; this file has no scoring or activation role. |
| [`cp-mapping-all484-hardened.json`](cp-mapping-all484-hardened.json) | `634e95279a2fb1078b3547616f29ddfc0a38ffe03f0b487fa0688be95aadbe81` | Inactive research sweep over 484 cases and all 101,156 case/probe rows. It retains 100,281 valid rows and all 875 invalid rows with explicit reasons. It has no submission, scoring, or activation role. |
| [`cp-stl-inventory-all484-hardened.json`](cp-stl-inventory-all484-hardened.json) | `cd4e1788a633196524b11f9d5f8868df05b71b11fed7fdf86892678c9cf41676` | Inactive research named-STL inventory for 484 cases: 364,568,214 raw facets, 23,716 named solids, and 68,902,520,476 source bytes. It is deliberately separate from the native-source pin and is not scoring support or an activation dependency. |
| [`cp-owner-review-atlas-all484-hardened.manifest.json`](cp-owner-review-atlas-all484-hardened.manifest.json) | `6a72536911010bdb741586018d1a13887f19756e135e8d35e6ea2da4b9fc7c4c` | Compact manifest for the external 488-page inactive discrete-probe research atlas. It covers all 484 cases and retains all 101,156 rows, including 875 invalid rows and 999 review-flagged rows. The external PDF is hash-bound as `e133fa14b6150c6f60590d19ba9b590072da0b758a19383976739c0f0fce654e`; visual sign-off is not claimed or required for the current probe-free contract. |
| [`volume-cell-types-run_1-pilot.json`](volume-cell-types-run_1-pilot.json) | `63f4c794807fd4d327d2e5017db585b41047c758e1ca9eeb4d22f2010817092e` | Diagnostic-only native-cell inventory for `run_1`; it is not a volume-weight definition or positivity result. The mesh contains 6,349,119 `vtkPolyhedron` cells. |
| [`volume-cell-types-run_44-pilot.json`](volume-cell-types-run_44-pilot.json) | `4f3a1cc6bf1c4010daf4a94c2bdf56cc9fb4a684e8cb2610dce6f00bcf482f71` | Diagnostic-only native-cell inventory for `run_44`; it is not a volume-weight definition or positivity result. The mesh contains 7,509,644 `vtkPolyhedron` cells. |
| [`cp-mapping-run1-run44-pilot.json`](cp-mapping-run1-run44-pilot.json) | `7200e6a97356b8edffa9e7eb1cd22fe31d79daf8551a7a9405273a6c5591a0ea` | Inactive discovery-only two-case Cp research pilot. The file declares itself incomplete with `public_evidence_eligible=false` and `public_scoring_support_eligible=false`. It records seven invalid mappings and omits 482 official cases. It is not scoring support or an activation dependency. |
| [`cp-stl-inventory-run1-run44-pilot.json`](cp-stl-inventory-run1-run44-pilot.json) | `db2b4031bf0051a51c4709f90e11eaee8b3886b858ce96649aa381778c9c5b0a` | Inactive discovery-only two-case named-STL research inventory. The file declares itself incomplete with `public_evidence_eligible=false` and `public_scoring_support_eligible=false`. It has no role in the current submission or activation. |
| [`transolver-run419-relative-cp-evaluator-smoke-v1.json`](transolver-run419-relative-cp-evaluator-smoke-v1.json) | `70851f3b1204255773f895a725156cb33d6c3bff7fabe6995c0ab2c64e552e5f` | Byte-identical retained Cp-cut evaluator report from real Transolver checkpoint inference for `run_419`. It exhausted and hash-verified all eight surface prediction chunks and records the four real relative Cp series, including their evaluator-produced support identities. It is a one-case positive integration fixture only: report-only weight remains zero, it does not itself freeze the evaluator or bind checkpoint identity, and it is not a submission, quality claim, sensitivity review, approval, or activation artifact. |
| [`transolver-run419-relative-velocity-evaluator-smoke-v1.json`](transolver-run419-relative-velocity-evaluator-smoke-v1.json) | `b6c35ba11938506e5d4897a81ad459db1383e56472207d489d63a843ae4be417` | Byte-identical retained velocity-profile evaluator report from real Transolver checkpoint inference for `run_419`. It exhausted and hash-verified all 122 volume prediction chunks and contains prediction/truth series for all 16 relative velocity stations. This report predates per-station support and placement-receipt identity emission; only family-level mapping and receipt hashes are present, so it cannot by itself exercise the relative submission semantic identity fields. It is a one-case report-only smoke fixture, not all-case sensitivity, scoring support, approval, or activation evidence. |

The two `run_419` files above deliberately retain the evaluator's exact bytes,
including its own scope-limit declarations. The Cp report can be checked directly
against the all-case support index for all four relative Cp support identities.
For velocity, only station coverage and real prediction/truth transport can be
checked: adding missing per-station identities after the fact would fabricate
evidence, so the fixture records that limitation instead.

## Current blockers

The owner selected equal-native-cell volume scoring on 2026-08-20. Geometric
cell-volume generation is therefore not an activation gate. The retained VTK
experiments above are historical provenance only and must not be interpreted as
current scoring support.

The all-case Cp research sweep, source inventory, truth replay, review atlas,
and two-case pilots remain hash-bound for provenance. The 875 invalid rows and
999 review flags remain visible, but resolving them and signing off the atlas
are no longer activation blockers because the discrete probes are outside the
submission and score. These artifacts must not be promoted into the current
scoring-support release or treated as support for the retained continuous Cp
cuts. Freezing and validating the distinct four-cut extraction remains an
activation task.

The two-case velocity pilot exercises the deterministic candidate-v7 geometry
kernel. Its compact aggregate accounts for all 4,489 invalid rows, while the
hash-bound external row-level files retain them explicitly. It does not cover
the other 482 cases, replay the required 0.5, 1, and 2 micrometre tolerances,
establish prediction convergence or method ordering, or supply an owner
validity mask. The candidate `1e-3` steradian polyhedron-classification
tolerance also remains subject to owner scientific approval.

The required real-input two-case reference-driver pilot has now passed and is
hash-bound above. This closes only that implementation subgate: it uses a
deterministic all-zero transport fixture, covers two of 484 cases, and is not a
trained-model result, physics-null denominator, independent participant dry
run, frozen evaluator release, or owner-approved scoring support.

## Provenance limits

The force aggregate was produced by
`scripts/audit_drivaerml_force_case.py` and
`scripts/aggregate_drivaerml_force_replay.py`. Both native-volume aggregates
were produced by `scripts/audit_drivaerml_native_volume_case.py` and
`scripts/aggregate_drivaerml_native_volume_audits.py`; the complete aggregate
strictly revalidated all 484 case receipts and was reproduced byte-for-byte.
Its companion provenance file binds the exact Git revision, runtime, launcher,
and the ordered hashes of the external case receipts.
Those retained artifacts use the earlier v1 receipt vocabulary, in which the
unit-weight declaration was named `volume_weights`; their bound generating
revision remains the reproducibility source. The current v2 tools accept only
the unambiguous `volume_weighting: one_per_native_cell` schema and do not accept
or generate geometric volume arrays.
The inactive Cp research files were produced by the candidate Cp builder,
strict aggregator, and
`scripts/build_drivaerml_cp_owner_review_atlas.py`; the cell-type files were
produced by `scripts/audit_drivaerml_volume_cell_types.py`. The superseded
physical-volume failure diagnostic records an execution of the hash-bound
`reference/drivaerml/volume_weights.py` snapshot. Its 1,128-byte stderr log is
external and is bound by SHA-256 in the diagnostic; no generated weight array
or success receipt exists. The VTK 9.6.0 record similarly binds a compact
external probe, its script, exact NumPy and VTK wheels, and the upstream VTK
tag/commit. Neither historical experiment has a role in the current contract.

Current candidate source readers include retained-descriptor identity checks,
but compact aggregate JSON cannot by itself demonstrate that runtime mechanism.
The all-484 equal-cell audit now has a companion manifest binding its exact
generating Git commit, runtime, launcher, and ordered receipt identities; the
10.7 MB per-case receipt set remains external. Other candidate aggregates have
only the provenance recorded in their own files. The 20,883,275-byte atlas PDF
is also external; only its SHA-256, page count, and complete compact review
manifest are committed. Those limits prevent this directory alone from serving
as an independently replayable immutable scoring-support release.

The velocity aggregate was produced by
`scripts/generate_drivaerml_velocity_assignments.py` and
`scripts/aggregate_drivaerml_velocity_assignments.py`. Its companion provenance
file binds the exact committed source snapshot, runtime, launchers, scheduler
jobs, and identities of both external case receipts and all eight mapping
files. A second process reproduced the `run_1` receipt and four mappings
byte-for-byte. The external row-level artifacts are not bundled in Git, and the
repeat does not extend the pilot beyond two cases or provide scientific
validation of the candidate kernel choices.

The reference-driver receipt is a byte-identical copy of the external campaign
receipt. Its separate provenance file binds the exact source commit and hashes,
runtime, launcher, scheduler execution, pathful input-config identity, compact
identities for every fixed input, and all four external child evidence files.
The large native sources, fixed arrays, prediction chunks, mappings, and child
evidence remain external; their hashes do not turn this two-case fixture into a
standalone or immutable scoring-support release.
