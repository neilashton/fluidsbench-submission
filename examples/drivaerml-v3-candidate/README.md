# DrivAerML FluidsBench schema-v3 candidate package

This directory is a configuration template, not a submission and not scoring
support. It deliberately contains `__REPLACE_...__` participant fields and
`__UNRESOLVED_DRIVAERML_...__` owner-release fields. Those strings are
machine-detectable blockers; they are not example hashes or release IDs.
The benchmark's separate release hand-off may already hash-bind a local v10
profile registry. That is not an instruction to replace this template's v10
tokens: wait until the active specification and all owner-release bindings are
published as one coherent release.

Use the shared [hardware and compute fields](../../METHODOLOGY.md#hardware-and-compute)
for each training stage and inference campaign, including GPU model and allocation counts.

## Inputs and blockers

Copy `package-config.template.json` outside the repository, fill the
participant fields, and use the immutable release values published by the
DrivAerML benchmark owner. Check what remains before attempting assembly:

```bash
python scripts/assemble_drivaerml_schema_v3_candidate.py \
  --config /path/to/package-config.json \
  --list-unresolved
```

Include the common [methodology record](../../METHODOLOGY.md) and the selected scope's outputs.
`surface_only` requires the two surface fields and four Cp cuts; omit volume predictions and velocity series, retain fixed
zero contributions without renormalizing weights, and do not fill missing metrics with dummy values (maximum overall score 60).
`surface_and_volume` requires all four fields, four Cp cuts, and 16 velocity profiles.

<summary>Required method configuration, checkpoint identity, stages, and parameter counts</summary>

The config-v2 format for schema-v3 packages requires a structured
`participant.methodology` record. Start from the placeholders in the template
and use [`methodology.example.json`](methodology.example.json) only as a shape
example. Replace all illustrative values with the submitted method's actual:

- named architecture components, exact total and submitter-trainable parameter
  counts, scoped hyperparameters and inputs, and the production path for all
  required fields for the selected scope (two surface fields in either scope, plus two volume fields only for `surface_and_volume`);
- normalization, preprocessing, and sampling plus every submitter or upstream
  training stage; submitter stages include their fitting procedure, runs,
  random seeds when stochastic, and measured compute;
- a raw-file SHA-256, byte description, component scope, role, and pre-test
  selection rule for every loaded checkpoint file; and
- complete-split inference campaign wall time, aggregate device time, and their
  inclusion boundaries.

`parameter_count_millions` is deliberately absent from the configuration. The
assembler derives it from `methodology.architecture.total_parameter_count`. The
checkpoint hashes bind the local bytes actually loaded for inference; they do
not require public model-weight upload and need not equal the hash of an
optional published model archive.

The template shows one jointly trained component and one gradient-based stage.
Add components, stages, and checkpoint-file entries when surface and volume use
different networks, when training is staged, or when a model is an ensemble.
For an upstream stage use `status=performed_upstream`, a component scope, and
an upstream reference. This provenance choice is independent of the top-level
target-data `training_regime`.

## Commands: assemble

The token report does not validate repository bindings or evaluator outputs;
successful assembly is the authoritative readiness check. Once the
owner-release fields are published and the frozen evaluator produces
a complete `metrics/cases.json` and `profiles/` directory, assemble the
participant-owned files with:

```bash
python scripts/assemble_drivaerml_schema_v3_candidate.py \
  --config /path/to/package-config.json \
  --case-metrics /path/to/metrics/cases.json \
  --profiles /path/to/profiles \
  --discretization-cases /path/to/discretization/cases.jsonl \
  --output /path/to/drivaerml-my-model-v1
```

## Outputs and validation

The assembler derives dataset and split identities from the checked-in
DrivAerML specification, canonicalizes the participant files, creates the
hash-bound `submission.json`, `evaluation-evidence.json`, and
`discretization.json`, and schema-checks the result. It refuses unresolved
tokens, incomplete or reordered cases, missing metrics or profiles, mismatched
release bindings, and an existing output directory.

Evaluator-produced `metrics/cases.json` and `profiles/index.json` must already
carry the exact submission, split, and case-set identities supplied to the
evaluator. `metrics/cases.json` must additionally carry the exact candidate
support release ID and manifest hash; the profile index has no release-identity
fields. The assembler rejects conflicts instead of rewriting them and verifies
every source profile chunk against the evaluator's input index before
canonicalizing it. Only the participant-authored per-case
`discretization/cases.jsonl` may omit its repeated schema/submission/dataset/
split identity fields; the assembler inserts those fields and rejects any
conflicting value that is present.

The frozen evaluator Git revision is benchmark-owned and is pinned by
`scoring_support.dataset_evaluator_binding` in the benchmark specification; it
is never written to `evaluation.code_revision`. That optional submission field
identifies the participant's public model code. The assembler omits it when
`participant.reproducibility.code` is absent; when that block is supplied, it
copies the participant code commit into both submission and evidence records.

The output contains no `approval`, `maintainer-validation.json`, or
`prediction-artifact-checks.json`; those are not contributor-owned records.
Complete native prediction artifacts are optional and are intentionally not
added by this initial assembler.

Use the [participant guide](../../benchmark-specs/drivaerml/PARTICIPANT_GUIDE.md#6-assemble-and-validate-a-closed-candidate)
for `--candidate-dry-run` after assembly. A pass is non-approving and never resolves missing release tokens or grants a rank.
