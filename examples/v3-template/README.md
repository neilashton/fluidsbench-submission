# Schema v3 synthetic template

This directory demonstrates the FluidsBench v3 structure with two tiny
synthetic cases. Its fictional dataset, owner approval, support, and result
are internally consistent so the complete contract can be tested. It is only
a format and evaluator fixture, not a recognized FluidsBench dataset, result,
or artifact check.

The `result_revision` block identifies this immutable package as version 1 of
the `synthetic-open-model` result series. A later update would use a new
`synthetic-open-model-v2` directory, set `version` to `2`, point `supersedes`
to `synthetic-open-model-v1`, and explain the change without editing v1.

The benchmark-owned chain is:

```text
support/manifest.json
  -> support/case-sets/standard/index.json
  -> support/case-sets/standard/chunk-000.json
  -> ground-truth tables
```

The evaluator joins prediction rows to the benchmark tables by exact
`support_id`. It rejects missing, duplicate, and unknown IDs. Coordinates,
weights, and ground truth always come from `support/`; they are never taken
from, interpolated by, or resampled from the prediction artifact. Every entity
in both synthetic case tables is required. Real dataset specifications apply
the same complete-coverage rule to their pinned original public files.

Run the synthetic calculation from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m reference.evaluate_predictions \
  --support-manifest examples/v3-template/support/manifest.json \
  --case-set standard \
  --prediction-manifest examples/v3-template/predictions/manifest.json \
  --submission-id synthetic-open-model-v1 \
  --split-id default \
  --output /tmp/fluidsbench-synthetic-case-metrics.json
```

`submission.json`, `evaluation-evidence.json`, `discretization.json`,
`metrics/cases.json`, and `maintainer-validation.json` show the required hash
bindings. Each case/support in `metrics/cases.json` also records the additive
numerator, denominator, spatial entity count, and total weight for its
relative-L2 metric. Those statistics allow chunked inference to be combined
without averaging chunk-level L2 values. Real dataset specifications declare
the required unweighted and area-, length-, or volume-weighted relative-L2 pair,
its primary metric, and the exact benchmark-owned weight associated with each
scoring point, face, or cell. `prediction-artifact-checks.json` is deliberately
maintainer-owned; a submitter may declare a pinned public Hugging Face
prediction artifact but must not declare its own check status.

The synthetic `submission.json` also demonstrates optional public code,
model, environment, and artifact-documentation metadata. A real v3 submission
may omit those optional fields without affecting eligibility. If included,
they remain subject to the schema's version, digest, URL, and licence checks.
